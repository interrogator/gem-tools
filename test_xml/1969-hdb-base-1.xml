	<unit id="u-1.25">Helsinki was founded in 1550 by Gustav Vasa, King of Sweden-Finland.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.26">The original site was at the mouth of the Vantaa River, but the town was later moved to its present position on a seagirt headland.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.27">The surface area of Helsinki is 44,810 hectares, over half of it water.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.28">A considerable proportion of the population - which exceeds half a million - live in the suburbs that have grown up around the headland.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.29">These suburbs combine modern urban living with the peace and unspoiled beauty of the countryside.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.30">In 1812, Helsinki became the capital of the country and the centre of Finnish political and administrative life.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.31">The President, the Government and the Diet (Parliament) work in Helsinki, as do the highest Courts of Justice and the Bank of Finland.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.32">Helsinki is also Finland's leading industrial city and import harbour, and both business life and scholastic research are concentrated in the city.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.33">At the end of the 1820s the State University, founded in 1640, was moved from the old capital, Turku to Helsinki, which then began to dvelop into Finland's leading centre of culture.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.34">There are a number of colleges in addition to the University.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.35">Helsinki has excellent connections in all directions by land, sea and air, and has thus become a popular tourist centre.</unit>

	<unit id="u-2.08">Relics of the 18th century are Suomenlinna, the sea fortress tha was in its day one of the mightiest in Europe, and the Sederholm House, in the Senate Square amid the Empire style old centre, built in the 19th century.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.09">The centre was designed by J. A. Ehrenström and C. L. Engel.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.10">The Square is bordered by the Cathedral, the Government Palace, the University and buildings of the Metropolitan Police Magistrate's Court.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.11">It has been said of Empire Helsinki that it was the last city in Europe to be planned as a whole and built as a work of art.</unit>

	<unit id="u-2.13">Architecturally, Helsinki is colourful.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.14">Among its streets the styles range from Neoclassical houses to the modern creations of great architects, whose works can be seen both in the centre and in the new suburbs.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.15">Well-known Finnish architects are for instance Eliel Saarinen, J. S. Sirén, Viljo Revell and Alvar Aalto.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.16">According to Aalto's plan for the city centre, the cultural and business life of the capital will be mainly concetrated on the shores of Töölö Bay and even extend out over it.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.17">MUSEUMS AND EXHIBITIONS</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.18">There are many interesting museums in Helsinki where the visitor can study all kinds of subjects.</unit>

	<unit id="u-2.26">Boat cruises explore the lovely Helsinki archipelago.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.27">Some of the most interesting sights of Helsinki are on the islands surrounding the headland, and have become real tourist attractions, especially Seurasaari with an open air museum, the fortress island of Suomenlinna, Korkeasaari with the City Zoo, and Pihlajasaari, haunt of swimmers and sun-worshippers.</unit>

	<unit id="u-2.35">THEATRES</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.36">Helsinki is a bilingual city.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.37">This is reflected in all aspects of life, including culture.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.38">The theatres use the two official languages, Finnish and Swedish.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.39">The Swedish-speaking population is a minority group, but the Finland-Swedish culture is a powerful force.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.40">Both the Finnish and the Swedish theatres have an extensive repertory covering both classics and modern works.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.41">RECREATION AND SPORT</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.42">Helsinki's outdoor recreation and sports season is not limited to the summer; there is lively activity all the year round.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.43">Because of the city's situation close to the unspoiled countryside, skiers and swimmers can practise almost in the very centre.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.44">Helsinki's newest indoor sports premises, especially the Ice Rink and the new swimming baths, have done a great to narrow the gap between summer and winter seasons.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.45">But the chief setting for sporting events is still the Olympic Stadium.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.46">During the summer swimming season, residents of Helsinki flock to the many bathing beaches.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.47">Helsinki can also offer something fairly surprising considering its size - fishing right in the middle of the city.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.48">On winter Sundays crowds make for the frozen sea around the city to do winter fishing through the ice.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.49">In summer, anglers can fish for rainbow trout in specially constructed basins.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.50">RESTAURANTS AND CAFES</unit>
