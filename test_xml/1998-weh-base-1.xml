	<unit id="u-3.03">Typical of the Helsinki cityscape are large areas in uniform architectural styles, representing Neoclassical, Art Nouveau, National Romantic, functional or modern architecture.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.04">From neoclassical simplicity to modernism</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.05">The wooden houses built before 1809 have long since disappeared.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.06">The oldest area that has been preserved intact is Senate Square with its <unit id="u-3.06.1">neoclassical</unit> government buildings from the 1820s and 1830s, designed by C. L. Engel.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.07">The <unit id="u-3.07.1">Neorenaissance</unit> buildings from the 1880s, which made use of new building techniques, gave a continental look to the Esplanade Streets and the Katajanokka district.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.08">At around the turn of the 20th century whole districts were built in <unit id="u-3.08.1">Art Nouveau</unit> style, following new European influences.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.09">The Finnish version of Art Nouveau, the <unit id="u-3.09.1">National Romantic</unit> school, assimilated markedly national features.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.10">In the 1920s the emphasis was on practicality and <unit id="u-3.10.1">functionalism.</unit></unit>
	<unit id="u-3.11">New districts and residential areas grew up around the centre.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.12">The most familiar landmarks of Helsinki's <unit id="u-3.12.1">modern architecture</unit> from the 1970s are Finlandia Hall and Temppeliaukio Church.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.13">Even newer examples are the National Opera, the official residence of the Finnish President, MÃ¤ntyniemi, and the new Museum of Contemporary Art.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.14">The National Romantic facade of the Helsinki Telephone Company.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.15">Neorenaissance architecture at Erottaja.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.16">The Senate Square, in uniform neoclassical style, is surrounded by the Cathedral, the University, the Council of State, and municipal offices.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.17">Normally, snow keeps coming and going in wintertime.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.18">The tower of the Olympic Stadium, in functional style.</unit>

	<unit id="u-3.26">Meet the four seasons</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.27">Helsinki is definitely a city of four different seasons, which means warm sunshine in summer, cool weather and beautifully coloured leaves in autumn, varying amounts of snow and a frozen sea in winter, and bright and clear evenings and mornings in spring.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.28">Normally, the hottest month is July with an average temperature of +17.0 C, the recorded maximum in thirty years being +30.8 C.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.29">The coldest month is usually January, the average temperature being -5.7 C.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.30">Helsinki is located on the southern coast of Finland, very close to 60 North Latitude, which explains the abundance of light in summer months.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.31">After the longest day, around the 22th of June, the darkness lasts only 1 hour 20 minutes.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.32">The varying weather conditions have turned Finns into real experts at building and heating houses, as well as in winter traffic.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.33">Many special solutions, like snow removal machinery and central heating, have been developed to guarantee uninterrupted traffic and comfortable living.</unit>
	<unit id="u-3.34">Helsinki keeps going all year round.</unit>
