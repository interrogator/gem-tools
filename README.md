This repository contains tools for working with multimodal corpora annotated using the Genre and Multimodality (GeM) model. To read more about the GeM project, visit http://www.purl.org/net/gem

The tools, which are written in Python and provided as Jupyter notebooks, use GraphViz for visualizations. That being said, to use the tools in this repository, you need both Jupyter and GraphViz.

Both are free and available at: 

- http://jupyter.org/
- http://www.graphviz.org/

Please use GitHub to report any issues with the tools, which are provided to you with absolutely no warranty at all. Use them at your own risk.

If you use these tools for your research, please use the following citation.

Thanks to Martin Thomas (University of Leeds) for designing the original implementation for drawing RST diagrams using GraphViz and Kaela Zhang (Hong Kong Polytechnic University) for testing the scripts and pointing out a wealth of bugs.
