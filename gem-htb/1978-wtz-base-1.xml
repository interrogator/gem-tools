	<unit id="u-1.01">THE OLD CENTER OF HELSINKI ---</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.02">KRUUNUNHAKA</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.03">Helsinki was founded in 1550 at the mouth of the Vantaa River, but was re-sited in 1640 on the peninsula of Vironniemi in the place that is today known as Kruununhaka.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.04">From as early as during the 17th century the town square with its church and cemetery, town hall and provincial Governor's palace were situated in what is today the site of the <unit id="u-1.04.1">SENATE SQUARE</unit> <unit id="u-1.04.2">(1)</unit></unit>
	<unit id="u-1.05">In one of the wars between Sweden and Russia Helsinki was burnt in 1713 and was occupied by the Russians from 1713 to 1721.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.06">Following the signing of a peace agreement, the town was re-built and new church, town hall, school and a number of merchants' residences were erected around the square.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.07">One of the merchants' mansions can still be seen on the southeastern corner of the square, the mansard roofed house <unit id="u-1.07.1">(2)</unit> built in 1757 for the merchant Sederholm.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.08">This is the oldest building in Helsinki.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.09">When Russia, as a result of the peace agreement concluded between Czar Alexander and the Emperor Napoleon, conquered Finland in the war of 1808-1809 and the country was annexed to the Russian Empire, Helsinki replaced Turku as the country's capital, because it was protected by the fortress Viapori (the old Finnish name for Suomenlinna) and nearer to the imperial capital St. Petersburg.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.10">At the beginning of the war, in 1808, Helsinki, being almost entirely wooden buildings, had been destroyed in a conflagration, all that remained were a few stone houses, the church and the town hall.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.11">Once again the town had to be re-built and the fact that it had been elevated to the status of a capital city gave a whole new dimension to the work of reconstruction.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.12">The fine new city plan was prepared by Johan Albert Ehrenström, who had been born in Helsinki and trained as a topographic officer in Viapori, moved to Sweden, where he worked as the secretary of Gustaf III and before returning to Finland travelled around Europe studying its major cities.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.13">The person engaged as the architect to the reconstruction committee was the German Carl Ludvig Engel, who had earlier worked in Tallinn and St. Petersburg.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.14"><unit id="u-1.14.1">Engel planned all public buildings, whether</unit> <unit id="u-1.14.2">they were administrative, ecclesiastical, educational or miltary use, in the neoclassic or Empire style.</unit></unit>
	<unit id="u-1.15">Thus it was that the Senate Square we know today took form.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.16">The wooden Ulrika Eleonora Church was demolished in 1827 (the place where it stood is marked by black lines in the cobblestones on the western end of the Senate Square) and the same fate befell to the stone Town Hall in 1838.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.17">The old square was expanded to four times its former size and new, handsome buildings were created all around it, producing the present Senate Square, one of the finest neoclassical squares in Europe.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.18">The Evangelical-Lutheran <unit id="u-1.18.1">CATHEDRAL</unit> stands on the northern side of the square.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.19">Its construction lasted from 1830 to 1852 and it was originally called "St. Nicholas' Church" (generally only "Nicholas' Church") after the name saint of Czar Nicholas I.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.20">Engel's original design allowed for only one large central tower, but following his death his successor, another German Ernst Bernhard Lohrman, had to add four smaller towers surmounted by cupolas around the central tower, because it was felt that without their support it might collapse.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.21">The fear of a collapse was also the reason for the church bells being placed in a separate pavilion on the western side of the building.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.22">The alter painting was painted by the German-Russian professor T.K. von Neff and was a gift of Czar Nicholas.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.23">The statues of the apostles on the roof of the cathedral are the work of Berlin sculptors August Wredow and Herman Schievelbein and are copied from the statues by Thorwaldsen in the Vor Frue Church in Copenhagen.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.24">The Cathedral is the first sight that strikes the eye when one is arriving in Helsinki by ship.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.25">It is also one of the symbols of the city.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.26">From the top of the steps leading up to the Cathedral one can enjoy a splendid view of the Senate Square and its buildings.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.27">On the left is the Senate <unit id="u-1.27.1">(3)</unit>, surmounted by the oldest public bell in Helsinki, which was built by the bellmaker Könni.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.28">The main part of this quadrangular building was completed in 1822, the other parts between 1824 and 1850.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.29"><unit id="u-1.29.1">Since 1918 the building </unit><unit id="u-1.29.2">has been used by the <unit id="u-1.29.3">COUNCIL OF STATE</unit> (Government).</unit></unit>
	<unit id="u-1.30">On the southeastern corner of the square is, as already mentioned, the <unit id="u-1.30.1">SEDERHOLM HOUSE</unit> <unit id="u-1.30.2">(2).</unit></unit>
	<unit id="u-1.31">On the other side of the street is the present Law Courts building, which was originally an 18th-century stone house and was changed into the palace of the Governor General in 1819 by the addition of a columned facade (Engel).</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.32">The buildings to the right of this were built as residences and commercial houses in the first half of the last century.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.33">Nowadays they are used by the police department.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.34">The dark granite building on the southwestern corner is the head office of the Union Bank of Finland Ltd.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.35">Designed by the architect O. Gripenberg, it was completed in 1936.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.36">The main building of the <unit id="u-1.36.1">UNIVERSITY</unit> <unit id="u-1.36.2">(4)</unit> is on the right-hand side of the square.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.37">The university was founded in Turku in 1640 and was transferred to Helsinki in 1828 after a major conflagration in Turku.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.38">Having worked in temporary accommodation for a few years it received its own building in 1832.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.39">This building was extended to fill the whole block in 1937.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.40">The extension, which was in the same style as the original, was designed by the architect J.S. Siren.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.41">During the air raids in 1944, the Festive Hall of the Main Building of the University, together with its murals by Albert Edelfelt, was destroyed, but was quickly re-built.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.42">In the middle of the square stands a statue to the <unit id="u-1.42.1">CZAR ALEXANDER II</unit>.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.43">This was erected by the State of Finland in 1894 to commemorate the fact that the Czar had, in 1863, permitted the Diet consisting of four Estates of the Realm to begin meeting again after a break of many years.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.44">The beautiful figures around the statue's base <unit id="u-1.44.1">(5)</unit> as well as the figure of the Czar were sculpted by Walter Runeberg.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.45">The figure of the Czar is also partially the work of Johannes Takanen, who won the competition to execute the statue, but died while the work was still in progress.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.46">If we want to have a look at the surroundings of the Senate Square the best place to start is in Unioninkatu.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.47">This street was built on difficult terrain at enormous expense and was named by the Czar himself during his visit to Helsinki in 1819.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.48">The wall at the corner of Hallituskatu and Unioninkatu bears a metal plaque with reliefs of Ehrenström and Engel, the men who built the capital city of Helsinki.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.49">The wall is a part of the <unit id="u-1.49.1">LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY</unit> <unit id="u-1.49.2">(6)</unit>, which is regarded by many as the most beautiful of the buildings created by Engel.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.50">Behind the wrought-iron fence of an exterior wall of the Library is a bronze half-length relief of Alexander I, this was kept in the Auditorium of the University from 1830 to 1932.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.51">The next long building in the neoclassic style on the same side of the street was completed in 1823 to the design of Engel.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.52">It was meant as a school for the children of Russian garrison soldiers, was converted into a Russian military hospital in 1832 and has been a university clinic since 1919.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.53">Opposite it on the other side of the street is the Orthodox <unit id="u-1.53.1">CHURCH OF THE HOLY TRINITY</unit> <unit id="u-1.53.2">(7)</unit>, which was completed in 1827 (Engel).</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.54"><unit id="u-1.54.1">The building behind the church belongs to the Bank of Finland and in front of its entrance </unit><unit id="u-1.54.2">in Rauhankatu is a modern statue by Eila Hiltunen (1961).</unit></unit>
	<unit id="u-1.55">Across the street from the church is the banknote printing press belonging to the Bank of Finland with a statue by Väinö Aaltonen in front of it; the statue is called "Dawn" (1956).</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.56">The building at the corner of Rauhankatu and Snellmanninkatu is the <unit id="u-1.56.1">STATE ARCHIVES</unit> <unit id="u-1.56.2">(8).</unit></unit>
	<unit id="u-1.57">This building was designed by the architect G. Nyström and completed in 1890.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.58">The State Archives were later extended by the addition of an annexe and underground storage levels.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.59">The main building of the <unit id="u-1.59.1">BANK OF FINLAND </unit><unit id="u-1.59.2">(9)</unit> is in Snellmaninkatu.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.60">Designed by the German-Russian architect L. Bohnstedt, this building was completed in 1892.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.61">In front of the bank is a statue of the famous statesman J.V. Snellman (Emil Wikström, 1923).</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.62">Snellman succeeded in having Finnish recognized as an official language of Finland on an equal footing with Swedish, and also completed the process of replacing the rouble with the markka (mark) as the monetary unit of the country.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.63">Opposite the Bank of Finland is the former House of Estates, nowadays the <unit id="u-1.63.1">HOUSE OF SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES </unit> <unit id="u-1.63.2">(10)</unit>.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.64">The house was completed in 1891 to the plans of the architect G. Nyström.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.65">The frieze above the building's portal is a relief by Emil Wikström showing Czar Alexander at the Diet of Porvoo in 1809, when he, as Czar of Russia and Grand Duke of Finland, promised to preserve the country's laws and faith unchanged.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.66">This bronze sculptural group was long the largest bronze work cast in Finland; it is 1.5 metres in height.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.67">In front of the southern wall of the House of Estates is a bust of Leo Mechelin, lawyer, statesman and the first Chairman of the Helsinki City Council, a post he held for many years.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.68">The statue was made by Walter Runeberg in 1909 and was erected in 1943.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.69">At the end of Snellmaninkatu, beside the Cathedral, is the capital city's first post office, which was completed in 1853 as a two-storey building and later built up to its present height.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.70">Across the street from it is the Institute of Chemistry of the University of Helsinki and a collection of sculptures in a building designed by Albert Edelfelt (1869).</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.71">We continue past this to the Senate Square and turn eastwards into Aleksanterinkatu.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.72">There was a street here as early as in the 17th century.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.73">On the southern side of the street in the middle of a row of buildings is a small reddish house from the latter half of the last century <unit id="u-1.73.1">(11)</unit>.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.74">It contains the official <unit id="u-1.74.1">RESIDENCE OF THE LORD MAYOR  </unit> of Helsinki.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.75">Farther on, behind a small park, is the <unit id="u-1.75.1">HOUSE OF NOBILITY </unit> <unit id="u-1.75.2">(12)</unit>, which was completed in 1861 (architect G. Th. Chiewitz) as a meeting place for the aristocracy.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.76">The next building on the same side is the second-oldest house in Helsinki, a stone building completed in 1765 as a bonded warehouse <unit id="u-1.76.1">(13)</unit>.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.77">Its oblique angle is due to the fact that it was designed to harmonize with the stone buildings of the fortified zone of that time.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.78">The building now houses offices belonging to the city.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.79">The ferry to the island zoo of Korkeasaari leaves from the quay beside the small square called Meritullintori.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.80">This quay was the deep-sea port of Helsinki in the 17th and 18th centuries.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.01">We continue along Pohjoisranta.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.02">The houses on our left are tall residential buildings from the latter half of the last century.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.03">We soon come to a small park called Liisanpuistikko, which contains a monument to those killed in the Pellinki military expedition in 1918.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.04">A causeway leads from the quay to the island of Tervasaari, which served the merchants of the 17th century as a tar depot and is now a park.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.05">The red-brick building at the beginning of Liisankatu <unit id="u-2.05.1">(14)</unit> is the <unit id="u-2.05.2">WAR COLLEGE</unit> and also houses the Military Museum.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.06">It was built as a military barracks in the 1880's.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.07">We shall continue along Liisankatu, which was completed in 1813, the first of the broad, straight streets envisaged in the new city plan.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.08">"Liisa" is the Finnish version of Elisabeth, and the street was named in the honour of Czarina Elisabeth.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.09">At the western corner of Liisankatu and Unioninkatu is the building containing the first hospital of the capital, the University Hospital completed in 1832 (Engel).</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.10">In the small green area in the middle of the square stands a statue by Emil Cedercreutz called "Motherly Love", which dates from 1928.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.11">However, we turn right to Meritullinkatu and arrive in the peaceful Siltavuori area.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.12">At <unit id="u-2.12.1">KRISTIANINKATU 12</unit> we find the oldest remaining wooden houses in Helsinki from the beginning of the 19th century <unit id="u-2.12.2">(15)</unit>.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.13">The buildings now belong to the city and the City Museum has plans to repair and turn them into a museum.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.14">We go along Oikokatu down to Siltavuorenranta.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.15">After crossing the busy Unioninkatu we walk along Kaisaniemenranta to <unit id="u-2.15.1">KAISANIEMI PARK</unit> <unit id="u-2.15.2"> (16)</unit>.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.16">At the beginning of the 19th century this was a swampy area on the shore of Kluuvinlahti Bay, but in the 1830's it was drained and the capital's first park --- the "Company-Keeping Park", as it was called --- was laid out there.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.17">A restaurant that began life as Miss Kajsa Wahllund's kiosk at the end of the promontory and still exists --- many times renovated --- became a favourite venue for student celebrations in the 1840's and has retained its popularity to this day.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.18">Kajsa died in 1843, but her name has been retained by the park.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.19">This area also contains the Botanical Gardens of the University of Helsinki, which were established there in 1833.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.20"><unit id="u-2.20.1">The present stone main</unit><unit id="u-2.20.2"> building of the Botanical Institute was designed by the architect G. Nyström and completed in 1903.</unit></unit>
	<unit id="u-2.21">If we walk through the park we arrive at the "Freemason's Grave", as it is called.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.22">It is in a small mound on the western side of the Botanical Gardens.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.23">Here rest the mortal remains of Major Frederik Granatenhjelm, who died in 1784.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.24">The confraternity of Freemasons of Viapori erected the nameless grave stone surrounded by a railing.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.25">Before we come to the rectangular pond <unit id="u-2.25.1">(17)</unit> we shall have passed a statue of <unit id="u-2.25.2">FREDERIK PACIUS</unit> (by Emil Wikström, 1896), who played a leading role in getting the musical life of the capital started and also composed the music for Finlandia's National Anthem "Our Country".</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.26">On the small hill on the right is Jussi Mäntynen's statue "Elk" (1929).</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.27">To the left, in front of the Minor Auditorium of the National Theatre, is a monument to the famous Finnish actress Ida Aalberg.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.28">Created by Raimo Utriainen, this stateu is called "Curtain".</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.29">A walk through the narrow alley beside the theatre takes us to the Railway Square.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.30">On the northern side of the square, separating it from the park, is the <unit id="u-2.30.1">NATIONAL THEATRE</unit> <unit id="u-2.30.2"> (18)</unit>, which was designed by the architect O. Tarjanne and completed in 1902.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.31">In front of the theatre stands a statue of the Finnish National author Aleksis Kivi (Wäinö Aaltonen, 1939).</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.32">Directly across the square is the <unit id="u-2.32.1">ATENEUM</unit> <unit id="u-2.32.2"> (19)</unit>, designed by Th. Höijer and completed in 1887.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.33">The Art Museum of the Ateneum contains the best art collection in the country.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.34">The University of Industrial Arts also functions in the rather cramped surroundings in the same building.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.35">The western side of the square is bounded by the <unit id="u-2.35.1">RAILWAY STATION</unit> <unit id="u-2.35.2">(21)</unit>, created by Eliel Saarinen and completed in 1916.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.36">The first railway line in Finland --- from Helsinki to Hämeenlinna --- was opened in 1862.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.37">To complete our tour we can have a look at the <unit id="u-2.37.1">CITY BUILDING</unit> <unit id="u-2.37.2">(20)</unit>, a modern business complex and shopping centre built in the 1970's, architect V. Revell.</unit>
	<unit id="u-2.38">The complex contains a high-level car park, shops, restaurants and, beneath both building and street, a pedestrian tunnel --- the Station Tunnel -- containing dozens of shops and supermarkets.</unit>
