		<segment id="s-1.02" xref="u-1.02">KRUUNUNHAKA</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.03" xref="u-1.03">Helsinki was founded in 1550 at the mouth of the Vantaa River, but was re-sited in 1640 on the peninsula of Vironniemi in the place that is today known as Kruununhaka.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.04" xref="u-1.04">From as early as during the 17th century the town square with its church and cemetery, town hall and provincial Governor's palace were situated in what is today the site of the SENATE SQUARE (1).</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.05" xref="u-1.05">In one of the wars between Sweden and Russia Helsinki was burnt in 1713 and was occupied by the Russians from 1713 to 1721.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.06" xref="u-1.06">Following the signing of a peace agreement, the town was re-built and new church, town hall, school and a number of merchants' residences were erected around the square.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.07" xref="u-1.07">One of the merchants' mansions can still be seen on the southeastern corner of the square, the mansard roofed house (2) built in 1757 for the merchant Sederholm.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.08" xref="u-1.08">This is the oldest building in Helsinki.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.09" xref="u-1.09">When Russia, as a result of the peace agreement concluded between Czar Alexander and the Emperor Napoleon, conquered Finland in the war of 1808-1809 and the country was annexed to the Russian Empire, Helsinki replaced Turku as the country's capital, because it was protected by the fortress Viapori (the old Finnish name for Suomenlinna) and nearer to the imperial capital St. Petersburg.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.10" xref="u-1.10">At the beginning of the war, in 1808, Helsinki, being almost entirely wooden buildings, had been destroyed in a conflagration, all that remained were a few stone houses, the church and the town hall.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.11" xref="u-1.11">Once again the town had to be re-built and the fact that it had been elevated to the status of a capital city gave a whole new dimension to the work of reconstruction.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.12" xref="u-1.12">The fine new city plan was prepared by Johan Albert Ehrenström, who had been born in Helsinki and trained as a topographic officer in Viapori, moved to Sweden, where he worked as the secretary of Gustaf III and before returning to Finland travelled around Europe studying its major cities.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.13" xref="u-1.13">The person engaged as the architect to the reconstruction committee was the German Carl Ludvig Engel, who had earlier worked in Tallinn and St. Petersburg.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.14" xref="u-1.14">Engel planned all public buildings, whether they were administrative, ecclesiastical, educational or miltary use, in the neoclassic or Empire style.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.15" xref="u-1.15">Thus it was that the Senate Square we know today took form.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.16" xref="u-1.16">The wooden Ulrika Eleonora Church was demolished in 1827 (the place where it stood is marked by black lines in the cobblestones on the western end of the Senate Square) and the same fate befell to the stone Town Hall in 1838.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.17" xref="u-1.17">The old square was expanded to four times its former size and new, handsome buildings were created all around it, producing the present Senate Square, one of the finest neoclassical squares in Europe.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.18" xref="u-1.18">The Evangelical-Lutheran CATHEDRAL stands on the northern side of the square.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.19" xref="u-1.19">Its construction lasted from 1830 to 1852 and it was originally called "St. Nicholas' Church" (generally only "Nicholas' Church") after the name saint of Czar Nicholas I.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.20" xref="u-1.20">Engel's original design allowed for only one large central tower, but following his death his successor, another German Ernst Bernhard Lohrman, had to add four smaller towers surmounted by cupolas around the central tower, because it was felt that without their support it might collapse.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.21" xref="u-1.21">The fear of a collapse was also the reason for the church bells being placed in a separate pavilion on the western side of the building.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.22" xref="u-1.22">The alter painting was painted by the German-Russian professor T.K. von Neff and was a gift of Czar Nicholas.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.23" xref="u-1.23">The statues of the apostles on the roof of the cathedral are the work of Berlin sculptors August Wredow and Herman Schievelbein and are copied from the statues by Thorwaldsen in the Vor Frue Church in Copenhagen.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.24" xref="u-1.24">The Cathedral is the first sight that strikes the eye when one is arriving in Helsinki by ship.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.25" xref="u-1.25">It is also one of the symbols of the city.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.26" xref="u-1.26">From the top of the steps leading up to the Cathedral one can enjoy a splendid view of the Senate Square and its buildings.</segment>

		<segment id="s-1.32" xref="u-1.32">The buildings to the right of this were built as residences and commercial houses in the first half of the last century.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.33" xref="u-1.33">Nowadays they are used by the police department.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.34" xref="u-1.34">The dark granite building on the southwestern corner is the head office of the Union Bank of Finland Ltd.</segment>

		<segment id="s-1.39" xref="u-1.39">This building was extended to fill the whole block in 1937.</segment>
		<segment id="s-1.40" xref="u-1.40">The extension, which was in the same style as the original, was designed by the architect J.S. Siren.</segment>

		<segment id="s-1.46" xref="u-1.46">If we want to have a look at the surroundings of the Senate Square the best place to start is in Unioninkatu.</segment>
