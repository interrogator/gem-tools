	<unit id="u-1.04">Helsinki promises an enchanting journey into a world of different architectural styles.</unit>
	<unit id="u-1.05">The salient feature is the Nordic refinement and preference for plain, simple lines.</unit>

	<unit id="u-1.22">Functionalism is magnificently embodied in the Olympic Stadium (1940) and the Lasipalatsi building (1935) right in the centre of the town that has just been cleverly restored to its former glory.</unit>
