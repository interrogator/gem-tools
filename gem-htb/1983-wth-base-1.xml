<unit id="u-2.01">ELÄINTARHA AND TÖÖLÖ</unit>
<unit id="u-2.02">To begin our walking tour of Eläintarha we shall assemble in front of the <unit id="u-2.02.1">NATIONAL THEATRE</unit> <unit id="u-2.02.2">(1)</unit>.
</unit>
<unit id="u-2.03">The theatre was built to the plans of Professor Onni Tarjanne in 1902; the frescoes in the parterre are by Juho Rissanen and the paintings on the ceiling by Yrjö Ollila.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.04">We can set off on our walking trip by going along the alley on the western side of the theatre, i.e. Läntinen Teatterikuja.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.05">On our left we have the administrative building
	<unit id="u-2.05.1">(2)</unit> of the <unit id="u-2.05.2">NATIONAL BOARD OF RAILWAYS</unit>, completed in 1910, and on the right a quadrangular building <unit id="u-2.05.3">(3)</unit> containing the Minor Auditorium of the National Theatre and the Theatrical School.
</unit>
<unit id="u-2.06">We continue straight through Kaisaniemi Park, with the fountain pool "Convolvulus" by Viktor Jansson and a bust of the composer Frederik Pacius by Emil Wikström to the right and on the slope to the left a sculpture, "The Elk", by Jussi Mäntynen.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.07">If we continue our journey we can see to the left a smoky railway marshalling yard and to the right, in sharp contrast, a verdant park, playing fields, and at the north-eastern corner of the larger of the playing fields, a grave to Major Frederik Granatenhjelm, a leading Freemason who died in 1784.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.08">His tombstone bears this inscription: "It doesn't matter whether the world knows who rests here. God knows of his deeds and the wretched bless his memory".</unit>
<unit id="u-2.09">The park itself dates from the 19th century and acquired its name from Kajsa Wahllund, who once kept a restaurant popular with students there.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.10">The restaurant <unit id="u-2.10.1">(4)</unit> is now well over a hundred years old.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.11">We shall leave it to our left as we proceed to the waterfront and then turn sharp right, noticing on our left one of the <unit id="u-2.11.1">BOTANICAL GARDENS OF THE UNIVERSITY</unit> of Helsinki <unit id="u-2.11.2">(5)</unit>.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.12">The grounds of the Botanical Gardens contain a stone table used by the Freemasons for their meetings.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.13">Turning left we cross over the Pitkäsilta or "Long Bridge", which was completed in 1912 and from which one can see Kaisaniemi Bay on the left, while the newer Hakaniemi Bridge is visible on the right.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.14">Directly in front of us is Lars Sonck's grey granite <unit id="u-2.14.1">KALLIO CHURCH</unit> <unit id="u-2.14.2">(6)</unit>, completed in 1912.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.15">Its steeple rises to a height of 95 metres above sea level.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.16"><unit id="u-2.16.1">On</unit> <unit id="u-2.16.2">continuing our journey we pass the restaurant Sillankorva <unit id="u-2.16.3">(7)</unit> and the department store Elanto Centrum <unit id="u-2.16.4">(8)</unit> on the left and on the right the shopping and office complex Meritalo <unit id="u-2.16.5">(9)</unit>.</unit></unit>
<unit id="u-2.17">It has a total volume of 100.000 m3 and contains numerous shops, offices and the hotel and restaurant "Merihotelli Cumulus".</unit>
<unit id="u-2.18">Thus we will have arrived at the corner of Hakaniemi Square.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.19">The flourishing market has had to shrink somewhat to make way for traffic and on the fringes of the square new buildings have arisen in place of the older ones being demolished.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.20">If we turn left into Paasivuorenkatu we shall see the small Paasivuori Park containing a statue called "The Boxers" by Johannes Haapasalo (1930) <unit id="u-2.20.1">(10)</unit>.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.21">An impressive sight in this district of Siltasaari is the <unit id="u-2.21.1">TYÖVÄENTALO</unit> ("Workers' House") <unit id="u-2.21.2">(11)</unit>, with its grey granite walls, red roof and steep pinnacles, which was completed in 1908 to the plans of the architect Karl Lindahl.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.22">We leave this building on our right as we proceed along the quay called Säästöpankinranta and arrive back at Hakaniemi Square.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.23">Directly in front of us we can see the <unit id="u-2.23.1">HAKANIEMI MARKET HALL</unit> <unit id="u-2.23.2">(12)</unit>, an indoor market, and opposite it a three-pinnacled apartment building, Arena, designed by Lars Sonck.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.24">On our right-hand side is the office building belonging to the Postal Bank <unit id="u-2.24.1">(13)</unit>.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.25">This modern building was designed by the architect team of Pernaja and Sandell.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.26">We now turn sharply to the left to follow the shoreline of the bay called "Eläintarhanlahti".</unit>
<unit id="u-2.27">The first building on our right is the circular building "Ympyrätalo" (The Round House) <unit id="u-2.27.1"> (14)</unit>, which was designed by Kaija and Heikki Siren.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.28">Owned by Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (a bank), this building has 9 overground stories and two underground levels.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.29">Its total volume is 125.000 m3.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.30">Having passed the Round House, we come to the <unit id="u-2.30.1">CITY ADMINISTRATIVE BUILDING</unit> <unit id="u-2.30.2">(15)</unit>, which was designed by Heikki Siren.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.31">The <unit id="u-2.31.1">CITY THEATRE</unit> <unit id="u-2.31.2">(16)</unit>, a modern building with a volume of about 100.000 m3 designed by the architect Timo Penttilä is next to the City Administrative Building.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.32"><unit id="u-2.32.1">On continuing our trip along Eläintarhantie we pass an area containing old wooden villas that are now</unit><unit id="u-2.32.2">condemned to demolition.</unit></unit>
<unit id="u-2.33">Crossing the railway line, we reach an arm of Töölönlahti Bay with the <unit id="u-2.33.1">DEACONESS INSTITUTION</unit> <unit id="u-2.33.2">(17)</unit> on the low hill on the right.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.34">The Deaconess Institution was established by Aurora Karamzin in 1867 to train diaconia workers.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.35">The present building was completed in 1898.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.36">Next we swing to the left along the shoreline.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.37">It is really worthwhile to stop for a breather at this point, because the view of the city from this vantage is very pretty, especially when it is lit up in the evenings.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.38">On the right is the <unit id="u-2.38.1">CITY'S CONSERVATOIRE</unit> with its rockeries and greenhouses <unit id="u-2.38.2">(18)</unit>.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.39">A bust of H. Bergström by Walter Runeberg (1888) stands in the forecourt.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.40">H. Borgström was the person responsible for the establishment of the Eläintarha Nature Park.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.41">"Eläintarha" means "zoological gardens" and indeed the gardens were originally intended to become a zoo.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.42">Their beautiful condition today is the result of decades of persevering labour.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.43">We now arrive at the hill called <unit id="u-2.43.1">MÄNTYMÄKI</unit> <unit id="u-2.43.2">(19)</unit>, where the labour movement traditionally assembles on May Day.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.44">Further to the right is the <unit id="u-2.44.1">SWIMMING STADIUM</unit> <unit id="u-2.44.2">(20)</unit> (Jorma Järvi, 1940) and the <unit id="u-2.44.3">OLYMPIC STADIUM</unit> <unit id="u-2.44.4">(21)</unit> (Yrjö Lindgren and Toivo Jäntti).</unit>
<unit id="u-2.45">The reinforced-concrete walls of the stadium enclose a green pitch surrounded by a black running track.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.46">The tower of the stadium is 72 metres in height.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.47">The annexe building houses the Sports Museum and the small park in front of the stadium contains a statue of the famous Finnish athlete Paavo Nurmi (Wäinö Aaltonen, 1924).</unit>
<unit id="u-2.48">The restaurant on the left called "Töölönranta" is a favourite spot for refreshments because of its beautiful location.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.49">The long, low building on the right <unit id="u-2.49.1">(22)</unit> was designed by Aarne Hytönen and R.V. Luukkonen.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.50">It was formerly the Exhibition Hall, but it is now used by the City of Helsinki as a sports hall.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.51">If we turn left into Mannerheimintie we pass the Office of the Finnish Sugar Company to our left.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.52">In front of its stands the "Sugar Girl" statue <unit id="u-2.52.1">(23)</unit> (Viljo Savikurki, 1956).</unit>
<unit id="u-2.53">The modern office building beside the Finnish Sugar Company's office ws completed in the 1970's.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.54">The park on our left with its walking paths and sports fields is <unit id="u-2.54.1">HESPERIA PARK</unit> <unit id="u-2.54.2">(24)</unit>.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.55">This park has been proposed as the site of several cultural buildings.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.56">These include <unit id="u-2.56.1">FINLANDIA HALL</unit> and its congress Wing, which were designed by Alvar Aalto and completed in the 1970's.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.57">On the top of a small mound is a statue of the minstrel Larin Paraske by Alpo Sailo (1949).</unit>
<unit id="u-2.58">The tall buildings to the right are modern hotels.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.59"><unit id="u-2.59.1">Further along to the right is the spendid creation of</unit><unit id="u-2.59.2">the team of architects Gesellius, Lindgren and Saarinen, the National museum</unit> <unit id="u-2.59.3">(25)</unit>, which was completed in 1906.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.60">The ceiling of the museum's main hall is decorated with frescoes painted by Akseli Gallen-Kallela and depicting scenes from the Kalevala, Finland's national epic.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.61">The small park beside the museum called Matiaksenlehto contains a statue of the Finnish ethnologist M.A. Castren.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.62">Behind the little park is the Ostrobothnia building, which belongs to the student fraternity representing students from the district of Ostrobothnia in northwestern Finland.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.63">This building <unit id="u-2.63.1">(26)</unit> was designed by Wäinö Palmqvist and Einar Sjöström.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.64">To the left, opposite the National Museum, is Hakasalmi Villa <unit id="u-2.64.1">(27)</unit> (architect Ernst Lohrman, 1846), the former home of Aurora Karamzin, which she donated to the City of Helsinki.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.65">Since 1912, it has been the <unit id="u-2.65.1">CITY MUSEUM</unit>, which provides visitors with an insight into the life and the ways of the old inhabitants of Helsinki.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.66">If we continue our journey we shall pass the <unit id="u-2.66.1">PARLIAMENT HOUSE</unit> <unit id="u-2.66.2">(28)</unit> built of grey Kaivola granite according to the plans of Professor J.S. Siren.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.67">It was completed in 1930.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.68">In the tiny park in front of the Parliament House is a statue of President Kyösti Kallio sculpted by his son, Kalervo Kallio, as well as, in front of the steps, statues of presidents K.J. Ståhlberg and P.E. Svinhufvud by Wäinö Aaltonen.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.69">To our left are the railway marshalling yards, which are soon to be transferred to a new location, and the functional <unit id="u-2.69.1">MAIN POST OFFICE</unit> <unit id="u-2.69.2">(29)</unit> built of light-coloured bricks and designed by j. Järvi and E. Lindroos.</unit>

<unit id="u-2.73"><unit id="u-2.73.1">(30)</unit> The low building in front of the <unit id="u-2.73.2">BUS STATION</unit> is called "Lasipalatsi" ("Glass Palace") <unit id="u-2.73.3">(31)</unit>.</unit>

<unit id="u-2.75">Alvar Aalto prepared a city plan which, when realized, will transform the appearance of these districts all the way from the goods railway station to Maria Hospital.</unit>
<unit id="u-2.76">If we proceed towards the <unit id="u-2.76.1">RAILWAY STATION</unit> through the street called Postikatu, we see the Sokos department store <unit id="u-2.76.2">(32)</unit> on our right.</unit>
